      <img src="assets/images/Me.jpeg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Hello! I moved to Seattle in late 2018. I am currently studying full-stack development with the University of Washington through the Trilogy program.</p>

      <p>I previoulsy studied classical piano performance and composition at MSU in Denver, CO, where I was very prevelant and active in the local music scene. My experience includes everying from teaching and small studio work to large scale recording and touring. </p>

      <p>I am excited to enter this next chapter of life and am motivated to combine this new field with my musical routes and begin composing and developing for video games.</p>
